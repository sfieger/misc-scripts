# misc-scripts
Collection of miscellaneous scripts I cobbled together (or found on the internet and changed them how I needed them) to acomplish things on different machines.

## Debian (and probably Ubuntu)
- start-services : starts services I use daily on my work-machines WSL2 Debian instance
- check-updates  : checks and prints how many packages are upgradeable
- attach-tmux    : checks if tmux is installed, we are in an interactive shell and not in an tmux session and attaches/creates to a "main"-session

# Installation
Copy the scripts to wherever you like, make them runnable (if you need to) and have a try.
